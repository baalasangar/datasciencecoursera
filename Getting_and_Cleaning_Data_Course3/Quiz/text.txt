	HOSPITALS already faced with severe staff shortages are seeing record numbers of nurses taking jobs abroad.Latest figures from the organisation that regulates nursing show that more than 5,000 nurses applied for work abroad in the year to March 2000 - the highest figure for 10 years. The United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting said that in recent years it had received a steady 3,000 to 4,000 inquiries from foreign hospitals.Now the number had jumped to 5,083. A spokesman said: "We don't really know why there has been this increase. These may be mainly short-term jobs." That increase was balanced by 7,383 nurses and midwives coming to Britain.
